| M2 Screw 3mm| 14 | |
| M2 Low Profile Screw 5mm| 2 | |
| Rubber Bump-Ons | 6 |  |
| Diodes | 32 | SMD diodes are required for low-profile switches. |
| Keyswitches | 32 | Either Cherry MX or Kailh Low-Profile compatible |
| Keycaps | 32 | Whichever caps suit the switches |
| 3.5mm Aux Cable | 1 | For the split connection |
| MicroUSB Cable | 1 | |
| Insulating Sheet | 1 | For stainless steel plates (Optional) |
| WS2812B Strip (6 LEDs) | 1 | For underglow (Optional) |
| SK6812mini | 32 | For backlight (Optional) |
| OLED Module | 1 | For OLED display (Optional) |
| Socket, 4-Pin | 1 | For OLED display (Optional) |
| Headers, 4-Pin | 1 | For OLED display (Optional) |

## Necessary Tools

| Name | Notes |
| ---- | ---- |
| Soldering Iron | If using backlight LEDs, it must be temperature-controllable. |
| Thin solder | ~0.8mm diameter recommended |
| Tweezers | For SMD part assembly |

## Selecting Options
Before beginning assembly, it will be necessary to decide on the options for the build.


### Row Quantity (5 or 4)
By breaking away the bottom row, you can select the row quantity.


### LED Selection (Underglow or Backlight)
Either the per-key backlight or below-PCB underglow may be selected.

## Building the Helix

The guide will focus on the left half. For the right, simply flip the PCB.

__It is strongly recommended to read the ENTIRE build guide first before beginning work.__

### Preparing the PCB

If installing the optional OLED display, jumpers must be connected.
Please solder the four jumpers on the __upper side__ of the PCB on both halves.
(Do not solder jumpers on both the front and rear.)

### Installing Parts

#### Diodes

Install diodes onto the __bottom__, whether through-hole or surface mount.  Note: if using choc low profile switches surface mount diodes are recommended as through hole diode legs would need to be flush on the top of the board to allow the top plate to sit correctly.  See issue [22](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix/issues/22) for details and work arounds.

Make sure all diodes are installed in the correct orientation.
Even when the silk label is invisible, all diodes face the same orientation.

#### Backlight LED (Optional)

Backlight LEDs are installed from the **bottom** of the PCB. Verify the orientation of the LEDs when installing - the largest pad should align with the corner marked with the circle on the silkscreen layer.


There are some places where this silkscreen is invisible; however, all LEDs of each row face the same orientation. However, **not all rows share the same orientation** (they switch orientation by 180 degrees each row).

Using a variable temperature soldering iron, solder the LEDs into place at roughly 220C (428F). __Overheating the LEDs will destroy the LEDs.__

An efficient method is to solder the largest pads on the entire row, then to do the rest of the pads.




#### TRRS Jack

Install from the topside following the silkscreen.

#### Reset Switch

Install from the topside as marked by silkscreen.

#### Pro Micro

Solder the spring loaded header to the pro micro, making sure that the bottom side faces upwards.

The recommended orientation is the following.

The smaller windows should be on the Pro Micro side.
Also, install so both sets of headers have the small windows facing the same orientation.

Installing in the wrong orientation or applying significant force before soldering will lead to the pins ejecting. Also, the legs are easily bent; please take care when inserting and removing the Pro Micro from the PCB.

Note the Pro Micro should be installed with the pins going through the holes outlined in white on the top of the board (The outside column on the left half, and the inside column on the right half)

With the bottom side up, insert the header-loaded Pro Micro onto the through-hole pads. Even without soldering, it should lock into place.

#### OLED Module (Optional)

Install sockets on the topside, and solder the headers onto the OLED module.
Install the OLED module so it covers the Pro Micro below.

#### RGB Underglow Strip

After verifying orientation, either solder into place or solder using jumper wires.

#### Switches

Install switches to the plate, then to the PCB, and solder.
Be careful of solder bridges when other parts are close by.

* At this point, it is recommended to flash the [firmware](firmware_en.md), and to verify that everything functions properly.


### Final Assembly

Install two 8mm standoffs on the topside, and screw into place.

Using 4mm standoffs on low-profile and 7mm for MX, secure the bottom plate into place as to sandwich the PCB.

Install the display-protecting plate using the low-profile screws.
